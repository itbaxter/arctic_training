It's good to have an index page for your website.
The index.html needs to have a lower case `i` or the first letter needs to be lower case.

General directory structure:

Docs/

    - index.html
    
    - all other hmtl files
    
    - to find the other html pages type in [userame].github.io/[project_name]/[file_name].html
